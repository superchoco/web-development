		<title>The God of Sky - HORUS</title>
			<body>
			<b class ="Ancient Egyptian god">Horus</b> is one of the most significant ancient <em>Egyptian deities</em>. He was worshipped from at least the late prehistoric
			Egypt until the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Roman Egypt. Different forms of Horus are recorded in history and these are 
			treated as distinct gods by Egyptologists. These various forms may possibly be different manifestations of the same 
			multi-layered deity in which certain attributes or syncretic relationships are emphasized, not necessarily in opposition 
			but complementary to one another, consistent with how the Ancient Egyptians viewed the multiple facets of reality. 
			He was most often depicted as a falcon, most likely a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanner_falcon">lanner falcon</a> or <a href= "https://en.wiki/Peregrine_falcon">peregrine falcon</a>, or as <em>a man with a falcon head</em>.

			The earliest recorded form of Horus is the tutelary deity of Nekhen in Upper Egypt, who is the first known national god, 
			specifically related to the ruling pharaoh who in time came to be regarded as a manifestation of Horus in life and <b class ="Ancient Egyptian god">Osiris</b> 
			in death. The most commonly encountered family relationship describes Horus as the son of Isis and Osiris, and he plays a 
			key role in the Osiris myth as Osiris's heir and the rival to Set, the murderer of Osiris. In another tradition <b class="Ancient Egyptian goddess">Hathor</b> is 
			regarded as his mother and sometimes as his wife. Horus served many functions, most notably being a god of kingship and 
			the sky.
			
			Horus is recorded in Egyptian hieroglyphs as <i lang ="egy">ḥr.w</i> "Falcon"; the pronunciation has been reconstructed as <i lang = "egy">ħaːruw</i>. Additional meanings are thought to have been 
			<em>"the distant one" or "one who is above, over"</em>. As the language changed over time, it appeared in Coptic varieties variously as hoːɾ or ħoːɾ and was 
			adopted into ancient Greek as <i lang = "grc"> Ὧρος Hōros</i> (pronounced at the time as <i lang="grc">hoːɾos</i>). It also survives in Late Egyptian and Coptic theophoric name forms such as 
			<i lang="cop">Siese</i> "son of Isis" and <i lang= "cop">Harsiese</i> "Horus, Son of Isis".

			<i lang="egy">Nekheny</i> may have been another falcon god worshipped at Nekhen, city of the falcon, with whom Horus was identified from early on.
			Horus may be shown as a falcon on the Narmer Palette, dating from about the 31st century <abbr title="Before Christ")>BC</abbr>.
